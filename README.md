# flask_4_databases_mysql_vm

## VM and Mysql set up process.
These two processes were somehow easy to accomplish because I followed the class notes and indications. 

## Database process
I created a Database called Alexandra in Mysql workbench with two tables with a foreign key relationship between them.
The two tables were abouth patients of a dental cleanic and their treatment plans. 

## Challenges 
1. My flask app opened but it did not show the tables content, even though it could been seen from the terminal.
2. It was no possible to deploy the app from Azure because I was not able to conected from the terminal.

Attached photos to proved the app running and the content of the tables.
